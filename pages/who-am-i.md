## Who am I?:

<div class="who-am-i-content">
  <p>🎨 <b>Artist Extraordinaire</b>: If it's intricate, I'm all in.</p>

  <p>🕺 <b>Shuffle Buff</b>: I enjoy dancing, especially shuffling. Two months of shuffling with a skipping rope taught me that combining two talents can be hilariously challenging!</p>

  <p>🏕️ <b>Adventure Enthusiast</b>: Hiking, trekking, camping—you name it, I’m there. The outdoors is my happy place.</p>

  <p>📚 <b>Fiction Fanatic</b>: Give me a novel with a good plot twist, and I'm hooked. As for self-help and philosophy? I’d rather watch them on screen.</p>

  <p>🧩 <b>Puzzle Addict</b>: Wordle, Connections, Strands, Spelling Bee, Cross-Wordle—you'll find me diving into New York Times games every day. It’s like a mental workout but way more fun!</p>

  <p>💪 <b>Fitness Enthusiast</b>: I workout every day to stay toned. With a great metabolism on my side, I put in that extra effort to keep things in shape.</p>

  <p>🎹 <b>Keyboard Newbie</b>: Just started learning the keyboard, so if you hear some off-key notes, that’s me practicing!</p>
