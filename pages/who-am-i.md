**[Home](/) >> Who am I?**

## Who am I?:
🎨 Artist Extraordinaire: If it's intricate, I'm all in. My sketchbook is my playground, where every line tells a story.

🕺 Shuffle Buff: I love dancing, especially shuffling. Two months of shuffling with a skipping rope taught me that combining two talents can be hilariously challenging!

🏕️ Adventure Enthusiast: Hiking, trekking, camping—you name it, I’m there. The outdoors is my happy place.

📚 Fiction Fanatic: Give me a novel with a good plot twist, and I'm hooked. As for self-help and philosophy? I’d rather watch them on screen.

🧩 Puzzle Addict: Wordle, Connections, Strands, Spelling Bee, Cross-Wordle—you'll find me diving into New York Times games every day. It’s like a mental workout but way more fun!

🧮 Finger Math Whiz: I was that kid who learned abacus and now does finger calculations like it's a superpower.

🎹 Keyboard Newbie: Just started learning the keyboard, so if you hear some off-key notes, that’s me practicing!
